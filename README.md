# bali-subrahmanyam-wen-2021-replication
Code to replicate the Bali, Subrahmanyam and Wen (2021) JFQA paper.

This code repository is written in Python and contains 3 script files which replicate the results in the paper entitled
"The Macroeconomic Uncertainty Premium in the Corporate Bond Market" by Bali, Subrahmanyam and Wen (2021).

The file entitled "wrds_bali_subrahmanyam_wen_2021_replication.py" replicates their paper with the publicly available 
bond dataset from thw WRDS Bond Returns Module and requires an academic (or otherwise) subscription to WRDS.
The script directly queries the WRDS Bond Returns database and downloads bond returns, amount outstanding, maturity, and
ratings that are required for the replication
